# Step-by-Step Guide to Push a Project to GitHub Using VS Code

## Step 1: Open Folder in VS Code
1. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
2. Click on **File > Open Folder**.
3. Navigate to the folder you want to work with and select it.
4. The folder will open, and its contents will be visible in the **Explorer** sidebar.

## Step 2: Initialize Git in the Folder
1. Open the terminal in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl + \`` (backtick) or navigating to **View > Terminal**.
2. Run the following command to initialize Git in the folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   This command sets up a new Git repository in your folder.

## Step 3: Stage Files for Commit
1. To tell Git which files to track, run the following command:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   The `.` indicates that all files in the folder should be staged.

## Step 4: Commit Changes
1. Save the current state of your files by creating a commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "First commit"
   ```
   Replace `"First commit"` with a meaningful message describing the changes.

## Step 5: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
2. Click on the **New Repository** button.
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., `my-folder`) and set it as public or private.
4. Click on **Create Repository**.

## Step 6: Link Local Repository to GitHub
1. Copy the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/my-folder.git`).
2. Link your local repository to the GitHub repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-folder.git
   ```

## Step 7: Verify Remote Repository
1. To verify that the remote repository is linked correctly, run:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   origin  https://github.com/your-username/my-folder.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/your-username/my-folder.git (push)
   ```

## Step 8: Push Files to GitHub
1. Upload your files to GitHub by running:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```
   This command pushes your local files to the `master` branch of the GitHub repository.
